# GatherGrid Project Overview 🚀

## Project Context
Now that the JEE development environment is configured and the basic architecture is defined, let's move on to implementing the various features of GatherGrid. In this project, you will work on the following components:

### User Management 👤

Set up an authentication and authorization system for users. Allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles (edit information, change passwords, etc.). Bonus: Implement user roles (e.g., organizer, participant) with appropriate permissions.

### Event Management 📅

Enable organizers to create events by specifying all the necessary details. Users should be able to search for events based on different criteria (date, category, location, etc.). Implement an event registration system for participants. Manage event publication, modification, and deletion.

### Ticket Management 🎫

Allow organizers to define tickets for their events (price, quantity available, ticket type, etc.). Participants should be able to purchase tickets for the events they are registered for.

### Comment Management 💬

Set up a comment system for events, where users can leave reviews and comments. Associate comments with the corresponding events and users.

### Event Categories 🗂️

Create an event categorization system to enable easier navigation.

### JEE Technology Integration 💼

Utilize JEE technologies such as JPA, Hibernate, Servlets, JSP, etc., to implement these features efficiently and robustly.

Ensure that the code is well-documented and follows JEE development best practices.
